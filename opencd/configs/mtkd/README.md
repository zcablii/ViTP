## Abstract

Deep learning has achieved significant success in the field of remote sensing image change detection (CD), yet two major challenges remain: the scarcity of sub-meter, all-inclusive open-source CD datasets, and the difficulty of achieving consistent and satisfactory detection results across images with varying change areas. To address these issues, we introduce the JL1-CD dataset, which contains 5,000 pairs of 512 x 512 pixel images with a resolution of 0.5 to 0.75 meters. Additionally, we propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MTKD) framework for CD. Experimental results on the JL1-CD and SYSU-CD datasets demonstrate that the MTKD framework significantly improves the performance of CD models with various network architectures and parameter sizes, achieving new state-of-the-art results. The code is available at this [URL](https://github.com/circleLZY/MTKD-CD).

## Usage

### Training

The training process for the MTKD framework consists of three steps. Below, we use the **Changer-MiT-b0** model as an example:

#### Step 1: Train the original model

Run the following command to train the original model:

```bash
python tools/train.py configs/mtkd/step1/initial-changer_ex_mit-b0_512x512_200k_jl1cd.py --work-dir /path/to/save/models/Changer-mit-b0/initial
```

#### Step 2: Train teacher models for different Change Area Ratio (CAR) partitions (e.g., 3 partitions)

Split the data according to CAR:

```bash
python tools/dataset_converters/split_data_with_car.py
```

Train the teacher models for small, medium, and large CAR partitions as follows:

```bash
python tools/train.py configs/mtkd/step2/small-changer_ex_mit-b0_512x512_200k_jl1cd.py --work-dir /path/to/save/models/Changer-mit-b0/small

python tools/train.py configs/mtkd/step2/medium-changer_ex_mit-b0_512x512_200k_jl1cd.py --work-dir /path/to/save/models/Changer-mit-b0/medium

python tools/train.py configs/mtkd/step2/large-changer_ex_mit-b0_512x512_200k_jl1cd.py --work-dir /path/to/save/models/Changer-mit-b0/large
```

In the above two steps, you will have four model versions for **Changer-MiT-b0**: the original model and three teacher models (small, medium, and large). At this point, the O-P strategy can already be applied.

#### Step 3: Train the student model

Initialize the checkpoint paths in `configs/mtkd/step3/mtkd-changer_ex_mit-b0_512x512_200k_jl1cd.py` for the student model and teacher models as follows:

- `checkpoint_student`
- `checkpoint_teacher_l`
- `checkpoint_teacher_m`
- `checkpoint_teacher_s`

Then, run the following command to train the student model:

```bash
python tools/train.py configs/mtkd/step3/mtkd-changer_ex_mit-b0_512x512_200k_jl1cd.py --work-dir /path/to/save/models/Changer-mit-b0/distill
```

After this step, you will have the student model trained within the MTKD framework.

### Testing

Testing the student model trained with MTKD is simple. Run the following command:

```bash
python test.py <config-file> <checkpoint>
```

Testing the O-P strategy is more complex. You can refer to the script located at `tools/test_pipline/single-partition-3-test.py` for more details.
